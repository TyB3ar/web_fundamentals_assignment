This is my submission for the Module 6 Lesson 1 Assignment. 

Of the modules present, the 'install_packages' image is meant to show proof of download of all packages needed to access all API's used. 

The 'web_fundatmentals' module shows access and display of the 'Pokemon' API, and all data retrieved from said API. 
When ran, the terminal should output first:
 - Pikachu name with abilities from json 
 - 3 'fetch_data' calls with 3 different Pokemon, showing each name/ablities/weight 
 - one 'average_weight' call which calls the function to calculate the average weight of 3 different pokemon (pikachu, bulbasaur, and charmander)

The 'digital_cosmos' module shows more knowledge of accessing API data with a function called to fetch specific data about our solar system. 
This function displays planet names, mass, and orbit period, and then adds them to a dictionary meant for ease of access for the other 'find-heaviest_planet' function. 
This other function calculates the heaviest planet out of this list of planets by mass from the API data, neatly printing the name and mass of that planet. 

Thank you!
